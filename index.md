# Facebook ad controls

This is Appendix C of Identifying User Needs for Advertising Controls on Facebook. In this appendix, we provide a summary of the interfaces we observed related to advertising during the course of our study. 

Our initial review of controls was conducted using Facebook’s desktop website with Google Chrome on macOS Catalina. We confirmed that these settings were also available through the Facebook mobile app (installed on an iPhone Xs running iOS 13.) We conducted the review using our personal Facebook accounts, each based in the United States and created over eight years ago, as well as an account created in 2020 for research purposes that maintained the default settings and contained no personal information. 

We began our review by identifying the portions of Facebook’s interface where the majority of its advertising controls are located: the (Your) **Ad Preferences** page, and the **contextual menus** available for individual News Feed or sidebar ads. We then examined these interfaces and enumerated any interactions that allowed users to change or control any aspect of the ads they see on Facebook, the data used to target ads to them on Facebook, or the data from Facebook Company Products that can be used to target ads to them off of Facebook. Last, we reviewed other sections (besides Ad Preferences) in Facebook’s Settings menu and identified any settings that seemed like they could impact the ads a user sees. 

We recognize that the Facebook interface is constantly changing and that users may have different options available to them based on variables such as region. The options listed here reflect what our team of U.S.-based researchers could observe on their own Facebook accounts but may be either a subset or superset of what other users have available to them.
