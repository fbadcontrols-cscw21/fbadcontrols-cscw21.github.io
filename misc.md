# Other ad controls
Here we briefly note other settings or informational features that are not in Ad Preferences or directly part of the context menu linked from ads, but that may impact the ad experience for users:
* **Settings** > **Video:** autoplay ads  
* **Other controls to edit profile information:* e.g., the decision to share or not share a birthdate may determine whether you get ads targeted by age
* **Location settings,** since location data can be used for targeting ads
* **Features such as transparency information about how ads are targeted, the labeling of paid content, and disclosures for political content:** These features are categorically different from settings and controls that users can change, but may impact how users interact with controls.
