# Off-Facebook Activity

As of February 2021, Off-Facebook Activity settings can be managed by clicking the downward arrow in the upper right hand corner (on desktop) or (on mobile) tapping the hamburger menu on the upper (Android)/lower (iOS) right, then going to **Settings & Privacy** > **Settings** > **Your Facebook Information** > **Off-Facebook Activity**. From there, a user can view Facebook's history of their interactions with other websites, clear it by selecting Clear History, or they can opt out of future collection of this data by going to Manage Future Activity. 

## Control: Clear History
Selecting Clear History will disconnect past off-Facebook activity from that Facebook account. This prevents ads from being targeted based on data collected up to that point. Future data regarding off-Facebook activity will continue to be collected and will still be usable for targeting ads.
