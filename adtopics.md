# Ad Topics

## Manage Ad Topics
The Ad Topics section contains a singular menu, Manage Ad Topics, with four topics (Alcohol; Parenting; Pets; Social Issues, Elections, or Politics) that a user can choose to See Fewer of.

## Control: See Fewer
Each of the four topics has an option to See Fewer of that topic. When See Fewer is selected, the button is replaced with the option to Undo the action, and a caption appears under the topic name that says "You're seeing fewer ads about this topic."
